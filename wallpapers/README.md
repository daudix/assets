- "Fedora Retrowave" is originally wallpaper for ZorinOS by [Nayam Amarshe](https://github.com/NayamAmarshe): [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/comments/u45tck/3840x2160_zorinos_wallpapers), they kindly provided me a `.blend` file, so I could make the fedora version myself. Thank you!
